# Description: Playbook to list VM's by Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager (OLVM) cluster
#
# DO NOT ALTER OR REMOVE COPYRIGHT NOTICES OR THIS HEADER.
#
# This playbook uses the following additional variables which should be configured at run time for the template, these are examples values used
# in the lab:
# olvm_cluster: cluster*
# olvm_name: ocne*
# Also, a password file is needed which contains the passwords for the local OLVM Manager as well as the root user for the VM.
# The password file is encrypted using the ansible-vault command. Once encrypted I created a Vault credential using this file.
# The template for OLAM needs the Vault credential as well as the local user credential.
# Within the lab OLAM server I placed the file in: /var/lib/awx/projects/files with awx:awx permissions for both file and directory.
# The files is declared below in the vars_files reference.
# The vars section contains the OLVM FQDN and user which should be edited to support your local environment.
